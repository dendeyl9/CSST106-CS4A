# **Exercise 1: Harris Corner Detection**

**Task:** Harris Corner Detection is a classic corner detection algorithm. Use the Harris Corner Detection algorithm to detect corners in an image.

* Load an image of your choice.
* Convert it to grayscale.
* Apply the Harris Corner Detection method to detect corners.
* Visualize the corners on the image and display the result.

**Key Points:**

* Harris Corner Detection is used to find corners, which are points of interest.
* Itâ€™s particularly useful for corner detection in images where object edges intersect.
